Simple Grid

Simple Grid is a jQuery plugin intended to be a no-fuss way to "replicate" your Photoshop grid on top of your development site.

Set these 3 variables to get started:

rowHeight
This is your line-height (most of the time)

columnWidth
This is your column width - it's BEST to use a number that divides the gridWidth evenly!!

gridWidth
This is the width of the area being gridded

Example

$.simpleGrid({
  rowHeight: 20,
  columnWidth: 30,
  gridWidth: 960
});

WHAT YOU GET

Once you've added the tiny bit of JavaScript to your page, you will get a pink dot in the upper left corner.

Clicking the pink dot will toggle the grid on and off.

Try it!
